export const WRITE = `## Analyzing Write Operations

This section shows a new file being created. Analyze the content to determine if it follows TDD principles.

### Your Task
You are reviewing a Write operation that creates a new file. Determine if this violates TDD principles.

**IMPORTANT**: First identify if this is a test file or implementation file by checking the file path for \`.test.\`, \`.spec.\`, or \`test/\`.

### Write Operation Rules

1. **Test file:**
   - Usually the first step in TDD (Red phase)
   - Should contain only ONE test
   - Multiple tests in test file = Violation
   - Exception: Test utilities or setup files

2. **Implementation file:**
   - Must have evidence of a failing test
   - Check test output for justification
   - Implementation must match test failure type
   - No test output = Likely violation
   - Exception: Refactor during green — types, constants, or helpers that don't introduce new runtime behavior

3. **Special considerations:**
   - Configuration files: Generally allowed
   - Test helpers/utilities: Allowed if supporting TDD
   - Empty stubs: Allowed if addressing test failure

### Common Write Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: Writing a test file
- Allowed: File with one test
- Violation: File with multiple tests
- Reason: TDD requires one test at a time

**Scenario 2**: Writing implementation without test
- Check for test output
- No output = "Premature implementation"
- With output = Verify it matches implementation

**Scenario 3**: Writing full implementation
- Test output indicates the symbol is unresolved
- Writing complete class with methods = Violation
- Should write minimal stub first

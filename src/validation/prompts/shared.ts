export const COUNT_NEW_TESTS = `### How to Count New Tests
**CRITICAL**: A test is only "new" if it doesn't exist in the old content.

1. **Compare old content vs new content:**
   - Find test declarations: \`test(\`, \`it(\`, \`describe(\`
   - A test that exists in both old and new is NOT new
   - Only count tests that appear in new but not in old

2. **What counts as a new test:**
   - A test block that wasn't in the old content
   - NOT: Moving an existing test to a different location
   - NOT: Renaming an existing test
   - NOT: Reformatting or refactoring existing tests
   - NOT: Combining two existing tests into one
   - NOT: Splitting one existing test into multiple tests that cover the same assertions

3. **Multiple test check:**
   - One new test = Allowed (part of TDD cycle)
   - Two or more new tests = Violation

export const MATCH_FAILURE_TYPE = `1. **Check the test output** to understand the current failure
2. **Match implementation to failure type:**
   - Import or symbol unresolved → Only create empty stub
   - Impl exists but call fails (signature mismatch, error before assertion) → Adjust signature, stub body minimally
   - Assertion failure (expected vs received) → Implement minimal logic to pass

3. **Verify minimal implementation:**
   - Don't add extra methods
   - Don't add error handling unless tested
   - Don't implement features beyond current test

Automated Test-Driven Development enforcement for Claude Code.

## Overview

TDD Guard ensures Claude Code follows Test-Driven Development principles. When your agent tries to skip tests or over-implement, TDD Guard blocks the action and explains what needs to happen instead.

## Features

- **Test-First Enforcement** - Blocks implementation without failing tests
- **Minimal Implementation** - Prevents code beyond current test requirements
- **Lint Integration** - Enforces refactoring using your linting rules
- **Customizable Rules** - Adjust validation rules to match your TDD style
- **Flexible Validation** - Choose faster or more capable models for your needs
- **Session Control** - Toggle on and off mid-session

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- A supported test framework (Vitest, Jest, Storybook, pytest, PHPUnit, Go, Rust, RSpec, Minitest)

### Installation

Open Claude Code in your project and run:

1. `/plugin marketplace add nizos/tdd-guard`
2. `/plugin install tdd-guard@tdd-guard`
3. `/tdd-guard:setup`

This adds the marketplace, installs the plugin, and configures the test reporter for your project. You may need to restart your terminal session or IDE extension for the setup skill to appear. For manual installation and configuration, see the [installation guide](docs/installation.md).

## Configuration

- [Custom instructions](docs/custom-instructions.md) - Customize TDD validation rules
- [Lint integration](docs/linting.md) - Automated refactoring support
- [Strengthening enforcement](docs/enforcement.md) - Prevent agents from bypassing validation
- [Ignore patterns](docs/ignore-patterns.md) - Control which files are validated
- [Validation Model](docs/validation-model.md) - Choose faster or more capable model
- [All settings](docs/configuration.md) - Complete settings documentation

## Security

TDD Guard hooks run with your user permissions. We maintain automated security scanning, dependency audits, and welcome source code review. See [Claude Code's security considerations](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks#security-considerations) for more on hook safety.

### [Conduct](https://github.com/nizos/conduct)

A policy engine that generalizes this approach across coding agents — Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot. Works with any language and test runner, supports parallel agent sessions, and ships rules beyond TDD.

TDD Guard's TDD enforcement is dogfooded and well-tested. Conduct's is newer and less proven, but its TDD validator sees recent agent activity for richer validation context. TDD Guard remains actively maintained.

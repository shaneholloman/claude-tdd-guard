# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TDD Guard. Contributions of all kinds are welcome and appreciated, whether it's fixing a bug, improving documentation, or proposing a new feature.

These guidelines exist to help your contributions land smoothly and increase the chances of your work being merged quickly.

## Before You Start

If you'd like to add a feature, add a reporter, change existing behavior, or make a significant refactor, please open an issue first so we can discuss the approach together. This helps us align on direction early and avoids situations where you invest significant effort on something that may not fit the project's current priorities.

Bug fixes and small improvements are welcome as direct pull requests, though opening an issue first is still appreciated so we can track the change.

## Pull Requests

Each pull request should address a single concern. A PR that fixes a bug should not also refactor unrelated code or update formatting elsewhere. If you find additional changes worth making along the way, please open a separate PR for those.

Use meaningful titles that describe what the change accomplishes. The description should explain what the PR introduces and why. For significant design decisions, include an [Architecture Decision Record](docs/adr/).

### Core Requirements

Implementation must be test driven with all relevant and affected tests passing. Run linting and formatting (`npm run checks`) and ensure the build succeeds (`npm run build`).

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits and communicate the why, not just what. Focus on the reasoning behind changes rather than describing what was changed.

### Reporter Contributions

Project root path can be specified so that tests can be run from any directory in the project. For security, validate that the project root path is absolute and that it is the current working directory or an ancestor of it. Relevant cases must be added to reporter integration tests.

#### Compiled and Typed Languages

For compiled languages, the reporter must handle build failures explicitly. When compilation fails, no tests run and no test results are produced. To keep the core validation layer language-agnostic, reporters for compiled languages should detect build failures and write a synthetic test entry with a failed state to `test.json`. This allows the validator to reason about the failure without requiring special-casing in the core.

See the Go reporter (`reporters/go/internal/parser/parser.go`, search for `CompilationError`) and Rust reporter (`reporters/rust/src/transformer.rs`, search for `compilation::build`) for reference implementations.

## Style Guidelines

No emojis in code or documentation. Avoid generic or boilerplate content. Be deliberate and intentional. Keep it clean and concise.
